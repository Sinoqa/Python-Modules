Always go back to this notepad when you are lost.
Remember how far you've come.
Look at all these old stupid code you wrote and compare it to what you are currently doing right now
You are doing so well. Keep up the good work and trust yourself
You are the only one who could help yourself achieve your goals. Not anyone else
